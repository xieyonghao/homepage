## **RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:**

#### **Key Member, Smart car project (Dec. 2017 – Aug. 2018), Project “Intelligent two-vehicle automatic identification and car-participation study” Supervised by Prof. Wu Kaizhi, Nanchang, China**
- Made two intelligent vehicles with automatic road recognition to recognize the right roads automatically, find the optimal path, and accomplish vehicle recognition and safe meeting on narrow streets;

- We made the essential car body, including the drive motor, steering servo, and other cart components; Then, we made the cart control and sensing unit, such as the K60 controller, driver circuit, camera recognition module, ultrasonic sensor module, Bluetooth signal transmission module. Finally, it would be divided into master and slave car debugging;

- The master vehicle signal and the slave vehicle signal were shared in real-time. Both the master and slave vehicles could recognize the correct road and choose the shortest path to travel. When the streets are slightly wider than the width of the two cars meet, they can complete the set road travel time in a safe form without collision conditions.

#### **Team Leader, School-level project (Sep. 2018 – Jun. 2019), Project “Fire fighting and rescue robot based on embedded structure and Internet of Things” Supervised by Prof Wang Changkun, Nanchang, China**

- The primary purpose is to design a robot with STM32 to identify the source of fire and extend the robot arm near the fire source to achieve the process of fire extinguishing, meanwhile, to transmit real-time information to the host computer to monitor;

- We built the control unit using the STM32 microcontroller, then used the OV7670 camera and wrote a recognition program to judge the object and scene, mainly through the RGB value of the environment, to distinguish the fire source. Then, we made the motor drive and servo control robot arm's to drive the motor and make firefighting action;

- The robot rotates to monitor the fire source when there is no fire. When the fire source was found, the drive motor approached the fire source and judged the distance from the fire source, stopped according to the program and the space set by the robot arm, drove the robot arm closer, completed the fire extinguishing action, and uploaded this process data to the upper computer for monitoring.

#### **Team Leader, Research project (Dec. 2018 – Jun. 2019), RGV Path planning Study Supervised by Prof. Wang Changkun at Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China**

- For an industrial product that requires the participation of multiple types of RGVs in its production, an RGV scheduling optimization model maximizes the number of industrial products produced by the shop within a specified time;

- We set up the production line layout of RGV according to the production lines in the enterprise production hall; Then, we specified the constraints of the production line according to the spatial arrangement and established an improved mathematical model for dynamic scheduling of travelers;

- Simulations were performed using MATLAB software. The data were substituted into the model for calculation, and the results were compared with the existing model. The results showed that the improved mathematical model created has a more significant improvement in efficiency than the original model.

#### **Team Leader, Research project(Mar. 2019 – Jun. 2019), Siemens Smart Manufacturing Challenge Supervised by Prof. Wang Changkun at Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China**

- We designed a logistics system with the function of indoor and outdoor automatic navigation. The logistics trolley can automatically communicate with the elevator and automatic door and implement control; the trolley must transport materials accurately;

- We used PLC as a central controller, STM32 as a slave controller, in STM32 and OV7670 cooperation in completing the visual recognition function. It sent the motor drive signal to the PLC controller and achieved navigation control. We used the intelligent car to simulate the elevator door and complete the automatic communication, and finally, we used the recognition of OV7670 and the robot arm to complete the material handling;

- The system navigation function was accurate, communication information was shared in real-time, and trolley handling material accuracy and efficiency were high.

#### **Key Member, Research project(Dec. 2020 – Present), Research on inertial sensor control methods and technologies (National Key research and development Program) Supervised by Prof Zhang Jiawei, Harbin, China**

- The research content is to establish the transfer function and noise equivalent model of each critical unit of the AC feedback actuation system, determine the noise source of the AC feedback actuation system, complete the noise index allocation according to the project requirement index, and establish the theoretical analysis and experimental research on the noise of AC feedback actuator. After forming the theoretical model, the noise in the time-sharing control mode and frequency-sharing control mode will be improved through hardware structure and optimization algorithm;

- Analysis of the voltage noise in the actuator, because the actuator works in the low-frequency band frequency, the noise mainly comes from 1/f noise, scattering noise, and thermal noise. Currently, the central attempts to improve the noise problem are: the use of digital and analog chopper self-stabilizing zero technology, reference voltage source temperature drift suppression, double-off double sampling technology, and the use of analog circuit form chopper self-stabilizing zero technology for noise suppression effect are good. There are two control modes in the control mode frequency division control and time division control. In the frequency division control mode, PID control mode and PID hardware structure are used to improve the noise level. The frequency division mode consists of FPGA, DAC, buffer, inverter and operational amplifier (DVA), and ADC circuit, respectively. The ADC circuit acts as a PID feedback unit; the voltage signal waveform uses a 30Hz ~ 270Hz AC voltage waveform; the maximum control voltage amplitude is 9.1V. Time division control adopts the PWM control mode. The primary circuit is composed of FPGA, DAC, and DVA circuits, using a 250Hz pulse square wave. Its maximum voltage amplitude is 141V because this mode uses a 20-bit DAC for analog-to-digital conversion. The main influence factors are reference voltage source fluctuation, device 1/f noise, suppressing reference voltage source fluctuation noise, and 1/f noise becomes critical. The circuit's essential parameters are optimized to select the optimal device parameters and obtain the best voltage noise level. Currently, the DVA circuit's circuit characteristics are mainly optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm and ant colony algorithm to get better circuit characteristics parameters, and the parameters considered are turn frequency, amplitude margin, phase margin, and other circuit characteristics parameters. After obtaining better circuit characteristics, according to the circuit characteristics data at this time, the specific model of the circuit is matched to complete the selection of circuit hardware device model parameters;

- I have established an AC feedback actuator for noise theory analysis, noise modeling, parameter verification, a clearer understanding of AC actuator noise sources, and pushing the relationship between voltage to force, I have mastered specific mathematical theoretical basis and noise analysis methods. In the use of python programs for DVA circuit parameter optimization, the use of chopping and parameter optimization, and other noise suppression methods to reduce the circuit low-frequency noise, I have a certain degree of programming practice.
